harmonicmixing
==============

uses the concept of "harmonic mixing" (link:____) to create a playlist (and upload it to soundcloud) from your music collection.

to do so, it discerns the keys (and bpm) of audio files in a directory using the echnoest API

this is a major wip. so it doesn't do any of this right now :)
